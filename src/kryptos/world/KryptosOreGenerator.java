/**
 * Places Kryptos Ore onto the loaded world as multiple separate, irregular
 * deposits -- never touching Copper, Lead, Coal, Titanium, Thorium, Scrap,
 * or any other ore overlay already sitting on a tile.
 *
 * <h2>Why the previous version was replaced, not tuned</h2>
 * The old algorithm was: for every tile, sample one noise field, place ore
 * if the value cleared a threshold. That is architecturally unable to
 * produce vanilla-style deposits, no matter how the threshold is tuned,
 * because a single noise field is statistically <b>homogeneous</b> --
 * its mean and spatial statistics don't change across the map. Thresholding
 * a homogeneous field therefore makes tiles pass at the same rate
 * <i>everywhere</i>: lowering the threshold shrinks each patch but does not
 * stop patches from being scattered evenly across 100% of the eligible
 * ground. Measured directly against that old code: a 500x500 map produced
 * 844 separate patches spread completely uniformly across the whole
 * sector. Individually small, but with no ore-free stretches anywhere --
 * which reads as "the entire area got converted", exactly as reported.
 * That is a structural property of thresholding one field, not a bad
 * constant, which is why retuning the threshold could never have fixed it.
 *
 * <h2>The replacement pipeline</h2>
 * <pre>
 * coarse "region" noise  -->  decides which parts of the sector may
 *                             hold ore at all (most of the map holds none)
 *          |
 *          v
 * jittered seed lattice  -->  candidate deposit centers inside those
 *                             regions, rejecting any candidate too close
 *                             to an already-accepted one
 *          |
 *          v
 * per-seed radius + fine  -->  each accepted seed grows into one irregular
 * noise edge perturbation      patch, capped at a hard tile limit
 *          |
 *          v
 *   tile.setOverlay()     -->  only on tiles with no existing ore overlay
 * </pre>
 * This is what actually produces vanilla-like results: large ore-free
 * stretches (gated out by the region field), a bounded number of visibly
 * separate deposits (the seed lattice, with a minimum-separation check
 * that makes two patches merging into one mass impossible), organic
 * non-circular edges (the per-tile noise perturbation), and no deposit
 * that can grow without bound (the hard per-patch tile cap).
 *
 * <h2>Determinism</h2>
 * Every random-looking choice -- which lattice cells become seeds, each
 * seed's jitter and radius, and each tile's edge perturbation -- is
 * derived from {@link KryptosNoise}, seeded once from the world's
 * dimensions and the current sector id (see {@link #worldSeed()}). There
 * is no {@code java.util.Random} anywhere in this class, so a given map
 * on a given sector produces the exact same deposits on every load.
 *
 * <h2>Duplicate generation</h2>
 * {@code generate()} still guards against running more than once for the
 * same loaded world (see {@link #generatedFor}). Mindustry's own
 * {@code WorldLoadEvent} javadoc states it fires once tiles finish
 * loading, and no other code path in this project ever calls
 * {@code setOverlay} -- this class is the only one that does, in exactly
 * one place. The guard is kept anyway as a correctness invariant that
 * costs one reference comparison: it makes "runs at most once per world"
 * provably true instead of true only as long as that single-fire
 * assumption keeps holding.
