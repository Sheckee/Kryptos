 * exactly one drone: spawned the moment its toggle is switched on, reused for
 * as long as it's alive, and quietly replaced if it dies. Both modules keep
 * their own separate drone (they call this independently), so turning both
 * toggles on gives you 2 drones total, matching one-drone-per-toggle.
 *
 * Automation only -- the drone is always locked to {@link KryptosDroneAI}
